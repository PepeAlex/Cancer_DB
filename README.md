# Cancer Deaths by US-State

I found this data in the site below:

https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/cancer/

The data has 51 rows that correspond to US-States and 75 columns divided by numbers of Cancer Deaths subdivided by Race, Years, Sex and three kinds of cancer: Breast, Colorectal and Lung.

I made some graphs to describe the data.
